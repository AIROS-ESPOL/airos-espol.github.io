description: >
  <p>The <strong>AIROS team</strong> visited <strong>Liceo Los Delfines</strong> to showcase our latest work in robotics and artificial intelligence. The presentation focused on how robots utilize sensors and AI to perceive their environment and navigate safely, even in dynamic spaces shared with people.</p>

  <p>A live demonstration of the <strong>"You Only Look Once" (YOLO)</strong> model showed how cameras identify and classify objects—such as people, cars, and traffic lights—in real-time at 45 frames per second.</p>

  <p>The session included an explanation of <strong>LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)</strong>. Students learned how laser pulses allow robots to measure distances and create detailed 3D point clouds and digital maps.</p>

  <p>The event concluded with a practical demonstration of the <strong>TurtleBot</strong>, highlighting the real-world application of mapping and autonomous navigation technologies.</p>
